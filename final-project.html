				    	The importance of user interviews is it provides instant feedback which leads to a better understanding what users expect. Depending on the type of questions asked, is the type of feedback one will get. At the user interview stage, it is important to ask open ended questions because they offer more opportunity for users to explain themselves. It is also important to ask question regarding what they expect to see and why they expect to see such things.

In this scenario, the competition is other Software Engineers/Computer Science peers and professional with website portfolios. I did a competitor analysis on two of my peers who are 4th year Computer Science and Software Engineer majors because this shows me what my peers are putting on their portfolio in terms of content, and how my site ranks against theirs. I also did a competitor analysis on a professional SE with many more years of experience than me because it shows me what I should aspire for my site to look like as I gain more experience in the field.

I created my user stories by first thinking about what purposes did I want my portfolio to achieve and that was to grab hiring manager's attention and contact me. From there I put myself in a hiring manager's perspective and began using the site which led to creating my user stories.

				    	A cognitive walkthrough is asking a user to accomplish one to ‘n’ amount of task while being observed by someone else. This is important because it gives feedback on whether the user could accomplish the task successfully, if they had any complications to achieve and the reason for it, or whether the user had no idea how to complete the task which can lead to additional feedback. The only challenge I had was scheduling times with users where both of us can sit down and go through the cognitive walkthrough thoroughly.

I also conducted a question test because I wanted additional feedback on the idea of having a floating button appear in every page for users to contact me. The overall results of my question test regarding having a floating contact me button on every page was a split decision. The only challenge I had was having enough test takers because I waited last minute to do my user testing.

					<h2>Summary of Findings</h2>
					<hr/> <!-- Horizontal Line -->
					<p>	
						Throughout the process of User Research and User Testing I learned many ways how my portfolio could improve. Starting with the user interviews and competitor analysis I was encourage to include a projects section displaying all the projects I have worked on. I quickly realize this when all my user interviewees mentioned how they would expect a project section displaying past projects when viewing a portfolio from a Software Engineer. Also, from all the competitor portfolios I examined I saw they included a project section which encouraged me to included one. Also, from the competitor analysis I noticed all the portfolios I examined used some type of framework, none of them used pure bone HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This encouraged me to scrap a lot of my original code, and start over using Google's Material Design Framework for the stylistic aspect.
					</p>
					<p>
						Moving on to the User Testing, from the cognitive walkthrough I noticed navigating through my portfolio is simple due to keeping this part of the portfolio conventional. There is either a hamburger menu for smaller screen devices or a navigation bar for larger screen devices containing all the tabs to the different pages in my portfolio. What I was most concern about was my approach on how to get in contact with me. My approach was to include a floating button on every page in my portfolio which when pressed, would display an email form. During the cognitive walkthrough, I asked "How would you contact the site owner?" and clicking on the floating button was top two choses users said they would go to. What I realize from this question was that although the floating button is not as conventional as having a 'Contact Me' tab, the email icon on the button gives users a good indication what the button does.
					</p>
					<p>	
						In addition, I created a click test and a question test. The click test was in regards to where would one click if they wish to contact the site owner. The results were positive because majority of people would click the floating button with the email icon on it. The downside to my click test was that my sample size was small, (four to be exact), which means I need to go back and increase my sample size before concluding that the floating button with the email logo is a clear indication to contact the site owner. On the question test, I asked two questions but the question that provide me with a better finding was the question regarding whether users would like to keep a floating button on every page for easy access to contacting the site owner. The results were majority of people would like to keep a floating button on every page. Although majority of users agreed to keeping the floating button, I would like to increase my sample size because from all the portfolios I seen, none take this route for users to contact them. By increasing my sample size, I hope to get a better understanding whether I should take this approach.

					<h2>Incorporation of Findings</h2>
					<hr/> <!-- Horizontal Line -->
					<p>	
						From my findings, I am making major changes to my portfolio. The biggest change is using Google's Material Design Framework. This improvement was inspired by viewing competitor's portfolio and noticing all of them used some type of framework. Also, I have included a page where I list all projects I have created and contributed to. I have incorporated this by adding an additional page named 'Projects' and using Google's Material Design Framework to create cards for every project. Each card contains the project's title, picture of the project (if available), description of the project and my contributions to it, and a link to the project (if available). Next, I have decided to get rid of my 'Contact Me' page and I decided to use a floating button which will serve the purpose of the contact me page. This floating button was inspired when I did a user interview with Jared, who has built several portfolio websites, and I notice my portfolio was heading towards the route of most common portfolios, which I do not want. 
					</p>
					<p>
						Lastly, I am in the process of changing the "About Me" page. The reason for this was because after talking to individuals who have hired others, I noticed that they mentioned how they would like to see more of the social life of their candidates. I am planning to change the description of myself to talk more about my social life outside the computer. Also, I plan to include more pictures of my social life.
					</p>
					<p>
						My biggest complication was learning Google's Material Design Framework since I have not used it before. Luckily, Google has its framework well documented which made it easy for me to implement. Also, I am finding it difficult writing my new description of myself because writing is not my strength and writing an entertaining description is much less. For this I am planning to ask others to revise my work once it is done.

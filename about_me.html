					Picking up my first book on investing at the age of 13 simply because my dad wanted to learn how the stock market worked, was one of the best decisions I could have done. At the age of 13 learning how to analyze, buy, sell, and make a profit from my computer was astonishing to me. Then at the age of 15 moving on to start my own computer repair shop business with my father, whom I respect and love, in literally what was at the time my backyard became my experience to the world of computers. Along with diving into the world of computers and technology, I enjoyed outdoor activities such as soccer, swimming, paintballing, etc. Today I continue to enjoy all of these activities as well as weightlifting and ping pong.
